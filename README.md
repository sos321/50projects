# 50 Projects

This is a compilation of small fun projects using HTML, CSS and intermediate JavaScript.

I gained a lot of practice coding these websites and broadend my JS and HTML capabilities. Every project was different and required a different approach.

These projects were made with the help of this [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/).
