# 50 Projects

These projects were made with the help of this [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/).

## Technologies

This is a compilation of small fun projects using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## What I learned

I gained a lot of practice coding these websites and broadend my JS and HTML capabilities. Every project was different and required a different approach. While the projects were small they showed me a lot of new stuff:

- Tailwindcss
- CSS animations
- Web component styling
- Using 3rd party APIs
- Using Font Awesome

## Biggest obstacle

Finding time to code and really focus on the given problem was the most dificuilt part of this course.
